# Alphabet-input-system-using-OR-gates-and-seven-segment-display
This project demonstrates an alphabet input system using OR gates and a seven-segment display. By pressing switches for Aâ€“Z, the required segments light up through IC 7432 logic, displaying alphabets without microcontrollers. A simple hardware-only design, ideal for learning digital logic and electronics.
